When we look at the Map of the World, Sometimes you would be wondering who would be bigger in size in between two countries. As Countries are different in shapes, it's difficult to know which country would be bigger in size than other country when we want to know about it. For example, We can't figure it out whether Japan is bigger or Germany, Or Indinesia is bigger or Chile. Using this App we convert each size of the country to a Circle. So when we place two countries's circle coinciding it's centre we can imazine the size of the coubtries easily.
